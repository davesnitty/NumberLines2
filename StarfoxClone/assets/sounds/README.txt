Sound Effects

For the full game experience, you should add the following sound files to this directory:

- laser.wav: Player's laser sound
- explosion.wav: Explosion sound
- hit.wav: Sound when hitting an obstacle
- enemy_shot.wav: Enemy shooting sound
- powerup.wav: Power-up sound
- gameover.wav: Game over sound
- levelup.wav: Level up sound

You can find free sound effects at websites like Freesound (https://freesound.org/) or OpenGameArt (https://opengameart.org/).

For testing purposes, you can use silent or minimal sound files until you find the perfect sounds for your game.
