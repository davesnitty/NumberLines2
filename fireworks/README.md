## Explaining the Code to Your Child

This game was designed to be simple to understand and explain to an 8-year-old. Here are the main concepts you can discuss:

### Basic Concepts

- **Canvas**: The game uses HTML5 Canvas to draw everything
- **Gravity**: Fireworks go up and then come back down due to gravity
- **Animation**: The game updates many times per second to create smooth movement
- **Functions**: Small pieces of code that perform specific tasks

### Game Objects

- **Barges**: The boats at the bottom that launch fireworks
- **Fireworks**: Objects that fly up into the sky
- **Particles**: Small colorful dots that create the explosion effect
- **Buildings**: The city silhouette in the background

### Fun Programming Concepts to Discuss

- **Randomness**: Each firework is slightly different
- **Coordinates**: Objects move around using x and y positions
- **Gravity**: How falling objects are modeled in games
- **Colors**: How colors are represented using hex codes (like #FF0000 for red)
- **Game Loop**: How the screen is updated many times per second
